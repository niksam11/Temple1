                India (Bharath) is the only country in the world that has followed her culture, tradition, customs, ancient dharma (piety), scientific views from time immemorial and for many generations. She has also given importance to moral, pious, and spiritual values.
            </p>
            <p class="vedic-paragraph">
                India is a land which has become a great platform for Vedic Aarsha culture. It is a pious land where Gods descended in the form of incarnations to destroy the evil forces and re-establish dharma or goodness. Many great rishis and sages have lived. In spite of diverse cultures, the land has proved to be one. She has proved to be a land for unity in diversity. Many great rulers have been born in this holy land.
            </p>
            <p class="vedic-paragraph">
                Many temples, holy places, and pilgrim centres have enhanced her holiness.

                Andhra Pradesh is a state in south India which is endowed with all the important features cited, and which is bifurcated now into AP and Telangana. Now Hyderabad, the capital city of Telangana has many temples.

            <p class="vedic-paragraph">
                In the Vedic culture, there is a system of Gods and Goddesses ruling the universe. There are three main Gods: Brahma ( the creator), Vishnu or Narayana ( the sustainer), and Maheswara (the destroyer). These three have been allotted the three activities or duties of creation, sustenance, and dissolving, respectively. They perform these duties with the help of their respective consorts Saraswathi, Lakshmi, and Parvathi. Of these three goddesses, Lakshmi , the consort of Vishnu or Narayana, is the Goddess of Wealth and Prosperity. She has manifested herself in 8 forms to bless or grace all the living beings in the universe. It is due to this goddess, all the beings in the universe are prospering.

            <div class="vedic-text-block">
                <p class="vedic-paragraph">
                    The temple is a grand well-built one, and it is attracting many devotees. The worship of the deities in the temple is done with the chanting of the sacred Vedic charms. This takes the devotees into a state of ecstasy. It is also a place of architectural beauty. The temple is a two-storey building. The ground floor consists of a kitchen, some shops for selling the Prasadham and also the office rooms. The deities are situated on the top-floor. There are two ways to reach the top-floor. The right staircase leads to the Ganapathi temple. After worshipping Him we receive His blessing and it gives us much solace. Then we reach the Dhwajasthambham ( a tall holy pillar), and the idol of Garuda. After offering a coconut there, we go for Pradhakshinams (circumambulations - going round the place). We offer our salutations there. This implies that all the deities receive our salutations.
                </p>
                <p class="vedic-paragraph">
                    According to the Vaishnava tradition, it is customary that the devotees have a dharsan of either God Hanuman or God Garuda, before having the dharsan of the main deities in the sanctum sanctorum (Garbhagudi). Accordingly , before entering the sanctum sanctorum where the main deities are situated, we have a dharsan of Garuda Alvar. Garuda is a staunch devotee of Lord Narayana and behaves like a humble servant of the Lord, and also remains standing at the entrance doorway as a door-keeper.
                </p>
                <p class="vedic-paragraph">
                    Through the main entrance, we go into the sanctum sanctorum – the Garbhagudi where we have the long - awaited dharsan of Lord Narayana with His consort Sri Adhilakshmi. Lord Narayana is seen having 4 hands. He holds the sacred conch (Shankha) and the sacred disk (Chakra) in two hands. He uses the other two hands to bless his devotees - one hand shows the Abhaya Mudhra (security) and the other shows the Varadha Mudhra (protection). His consort Sri Adhilakshmi is seen beautifully clad in silk clothes, decorated with jewels and garlands. Lord Srimannarayana (Narayana) and Sri Adhilakshmi are surrounded by the other 7 forms of Sri Lakshmi. The 8 forms of Lakshmi are Sri Adhilakshmi, Sri Gajalakshmi, Sri Ghantalakshmi, Sri Dhanalakshmi, Sri Dhanyalakshmi, Sri Vijayalakshmi, Sri Aishwaryalakshmi and Sri Varalakshmi. With the dharsan of these deities, the devotees go into a state of ecstasy.
                </p>
                <p class="vedic-paragraph">
                    The Ashtalakshmi temple is flourishing gloriously due to these 8 forms of Lakshmi. The idols are made exquisitely beautiful by being decorated with beautiful ornaments, flower garlands and silken attire, etc. The holy feet of the deities can remove all our difficulties. Their holy hands grace us for our wealth and prosperity. Their faces are seen brimming with divine consciousness. The devotees really undergo an unearthly experience, when they see the pious idols of the deities in the sanctum sanctorum. Their dharsan leaves an indelible impression in their minds. The devotees are spellbound and cannot find enough words to express their unearthly experience after having the dharsan of the deities.

        <div class="temple-content">
            <p class="temple-paragraph">
                Lord Sri Narayana and Sri Adhilakshmi are seen wearing garlands of Salagrama ( a kind of small holy stones). The devotees believe that this particular dharsan will wash away all the sins. The wish to have children for barren women ( women without children) will be fulfilled if they take the Garuda Prasadam by doing the Balamuralis. The deities grace the devotees with all kinds of prosperity and acknowledge their sincere worship through the Archaka. The devotees are in the temple for a long time. They are the embodiment of peaceful disposition. The all sorts of prasadams are there for the devotees. The devotees have a lot of faith in them. They believe that all the things in the world are the children of Lord Narayana and Sri Adhilakshmi. They get utmost happiness in their worship.
            </p>
            <p class="temple-paragraph">
                The supreme consciousness in the form of Sri Adhilakshmi has descended to the earth from the pure Ocean of Milk to dispel the darkness from the face of the earth. Hence this temple is rightly called a spiritual centre for the devotees. Many great people such as saints, sages, spiritualists, philosophers, devotees felt elated (happy) when they visited this temple. The temple's fame has increased with the visits of the holy people for the dharsan of the deities. In the Vedic culture two systems—Shaivism and Vaishnam are followed for the worship of the deities. The priests worship Lord Ganapathi according to the Smartha system, and Adhilakshmi and Lord Narayana in the Vaishnava system. The worship is done with pomp and ceremony. At the time of worship all attend with devotion. The temple has a special place or platform for performing Homas. Here, everyday in the morning and evening the Homa worship is done. This sort of worship is done particularly here in a nice and impressive way.
            </p>
            <p class="temple-paragraph">
                Everyday in the morning the deity is surplussed in the flower opposite to the sanctum sanctorum where Sri Adhilakshmi is located. The cow is considered sacred, because as the deities reside in the different parts of the cow. This cow is a descendant of the Kamadhenu ( the sacred cow in heaven). The temple has cow shed. The cows are given good and healthy food. The devotees can have the prasadam of the cow only after it has seen the deities. This sort of worship has its roots in the Vedic culture and tradition. This type of worship in the country too. All the types of worship performed in this temple originate in the Pancharthra Agama Saasthra – Sruvaishnava tradition.
            </p>
            <p class="temple-paragraph">
                The Sri Ganapathi Vratham is performed on every full-moon day in the devotees. Every Friday Goddess Lakshmi is worshipped with Kumkuma ( saffron powder) and flowers of gold. On every full-moon day, special worship is done with the Sri Sukthi – flowers and also the slokes (Slokas) for Lord Hanuman and Sri Adhilakshmi. Once in every month, on the last day of the last Uthraashadham, Abhishekam is done to the 8 deities. Sahasrara worship of Lord Ganapathi is done every month, on the day of the Sri Chathrti (Ganesha Chathrti is the 4th day of the lunar month). These worships are done with special decorations and offering of special food items to bring prosperity to people and. On every festive occasion the worship is done harmoniously. Every year they perform Brahmotsavas. During these days, many devotees come from every nook and corner and spiritual people impart their good advice to devotees ( Mangalasasanams). These holy festivals resemble the holy festivities of Thirupati. During to these festivities, the surroundings are kept clean and open with decorative leafy festoons, etc. People will be simply waiting for these special festivities.

                The structure of the temple leaves an indelible imprint in the minds of the viewers. As it is a marble structure, it shimmers gloriously in the moon light of the full-moon night. It has various components of the temple. It has a tower painted with golden paint. It has a holy door with electric lights at nights. Attached to the temple, there are a function hall to perform weddings and some other important ceremonies a platform to perform Homas and a cowshed. Really this temple is a spiritual centre. Daily, the worship is done for Lord Hanuman and Sri Adhilakshmi, and also Lord Ganapathi. There are quarters for the priests who perform different types of worship. The office looks run their office activities smoothly and meticulously. It looks as though Goddess Lakshmi has set out to help the temple properly.
